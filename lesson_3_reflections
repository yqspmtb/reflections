When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? When you want someone's help from github
and you may not necessarily want them to see your current master code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?  I may not want to broadcast my changes to the open source community.
